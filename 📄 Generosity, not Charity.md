Thereâ€™s a trend where coaches and consultants are being told to give first, to lead with generosity.

In itself thatâ€™s not a bad idea, especially when that generosity is meant to deliver value to a potential buyer.

But whatâ€™s not always explained, is the difference between generosity and charity.

Which is how quite a few people keep giving away free sessions, and never actually land the clients they give to. [[ðŸ“¯ This just in (really, you oughta take this thing seriously)#^1a898e|And so you end up with endless coffee meetings that never go anywhere]]. Also known as: the charity-trap.

But if you run a business, youâ€™re not a charity. Dollars matter, and if you donâ€™t distinguish between generosity and charity, youâ€™ll end up in trouble.

So if your lead generation is based on generosity, and if you tend to give people strategy, chemistry or discovery sessions as part of your sales process, thereâ€™s two important things to remember:

1: Never give to Takers, but only to Matchers or Givers (see: Adam Grantâ€™s <em>Give and Take</em> for an explanation on the difference between the three).

2: Get a picture of who youâ€™ll be giving to, where they're at, and determine whether this is the best time for them to benefit from your generosity. Qualify your prospects first, because the worst thing you can do for your business is giving your scarcest resource - your time - to people who arenâ€™t ready, or able, to hire you.

There's many situations where you're talking to the right people, but you'd be smarter to point them at a book or other resource first, and then re-engage and give to them later down the line.

That's how you run your business and sales process with strategic generosity, while avoiding the deadly charity trap.
