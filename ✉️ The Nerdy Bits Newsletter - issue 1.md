### If you were hypnotised, would you know? (AKA: AI has already done the damage)

So you think that AI poses a threat to humanity, do you?

Well, it does, and it's already done its damage.

Point in case: over the last few months in particular, but already going back a few years, I've noticed that more and more people sound like a broken record.

They'll say a thing, you'll present a counter-argument or different POV, or ask a question, and as if you had said nothing at all, ignoring your words entirely, they just repeat the exact same thing they've already said.

And these are people that I know to be intelligent, people I've known for years, who didn't used to talk like that. But somehow, their behaviour changed, and they just repeat the same things over and over again.

This is closely related to two other fascinating behaviours i keep observing:

1. People mindlessly repeating slogans or strongly held opinions (always the kind that the news and/or the media espouse)
2. People who you talk with, and it just sounds like they're reading the news at you (often in the form of "Have you heard...?" or "They're trying to...!").

Now this is only anecdotal, it's personal observations and my sample is small, but I think that we've been hypnotised by that charming mix of media and ad tech, and the algorithms that they both use.

That game has been running for two decades now, and I have a theory that it has reprogrammed people, to not think, but to just repeat what others say.

I think that AI over the last 20 years has made humanity dumber on average, and has turned us into spokespeople for whatever message or narrative a publisher can make most money of.

And obviously, the best way to create advocates, is to trigger outrage, fear and anxiety, which then neatly keeps people engaged in a virtuous cycle of checking the news, yelling about how bad everything is, and checking the news again to see if anyone disagrees, which you can then get angry about.

No conspiracy theory here - just a good-old economic incentive, leveraged with tech by people who are too stupid to think about the consequences of their business model, and with too much greed to care.

And I think that is what's caused so much of the divisiveness and conflict in the world. And that's real damage.

So that's my theory: we've been hypnotised into mindlessly repeating things and being angry. Which is of course a great way to bring the room down, but also:

Now that you're read this, you can never un-read it.

You will wake up in 3... 2... 1... **snaps fingers**

## What's new at SFC Headquarters

### Re-introducing the SFC DevLog: The Nerdy Bits Newsletter!

Early last year I pressed pause on the DevLog, because I realised I'd lost my view on what it was all about. And in the last few months, I've realised why, and also realised what this DevLog wants to be when it grows up.

See initially, I wanted it to be a type of *Build in Public* story, like people on Twitter do.

But I made a mistake, in deciding to what to share. See, since I'm not a developer, there really isn't that much I can talk about, in terms of the actual SFC app and the tech. Besides, it's all very simple, so there isn't much to tell to begin with.

But then I realised: what I'm building might be an MVP web app, but that's not the point. The actual point is that I'm trying to build a public repository of all my knowledge and methodology, a publishing platform, a narrative, a personal little media empire, a content provisioning system.

And that brings everything into exactly the right focus: Yes, I'm a complete nerd, and yes I utterly nerd out about things - but my deepest fascination isn't with building apps, or even content: it's human nature, behaviour and psychology. That's my favourite nerdery.

And that's what the DevLog is going to be based on going forward: reflections on humanity, relationships, communication and the way we relate to each other.

It's my favourite kind of topic, and it's why the DevLog now has a new name: the Nerdy Bits Newsletter.

\* If you're a dev and you used to enjoy the newsletter: Don't worry. The section *Cool Finds* won't go anywhere, and *Talk Dev to Me* will continue to live on as *Talk nerdy to me, baby*. 

So we're good, yeah?

Anyway. We're back. New name, who dis.

### Let's take it to the stage

Spring 2024, a quick trip back to Lisbon, and upon return I realise: Malaga is chockablock full with all the cool people and the nerds that I love spending time with. Just like when I go to Lisbon, or Ebinburgh, and I get to meet just the coolest folk, and talk dev and shop with them.

And since people here are clever, and keen to learn, and since I have a lot of things to say about sales and growth and I love being on stages, we started organising talks. 

The first one consisted of two back-to-back live coaching sessions, at [Polo Digital](https://www.polodigital.eu/), and it was FUN. So much so, that we're hosting another one on the 4th of September - you can [register here. ]()

### Team

December 2023, and I decide to put myself back on the dating market. I make a profile, see a girl Susane who looks nice, and we have a coffee.

Turns out, Susane is a sales pro with a great mind and attitude, looking for a job.

And so I propose to her: not anything personal, but to actually come and work for me.

That started in January, and it's been nothing short of fantastic, to have someone in my world, and my business, who knows and understands my goals and challenges, and can provide intelligent, thoughtful strategy and direction.

Basically, I fixed the self-employment problem called 'My boss is an idiot', because now I have Susane in charge of things. And she's no idiot.

Of course one does need to worry a little: I mean, if this is how I do dating... then what will happen if I ever go on a hiring spree...? ü§î

Oh well, that's a problem for future-Martin. For now, Susane and I are working together and we're a great team.

## Things the Internet is yelling about this week

Automated outreach! Lead gen on autopilot! New, improved, personalised video outreach!

Whenever someone asks me if they should use automation and AI to run lead gen campaigns on autopilot, my reply is:

Absolutely. We should all send better quality spam, and in higher volumes.

Each to their own, but I loathe and resent the poorly targeted, supposedly-engaging cold outreach that reaches my inboxes.

If someone pings me and demonstrates that they've selected me as a lead, as in: personally reviewed me and decided that there's a relevant reason to pitch at me, then sure: welcome to my inbox.

But that automated rubbish? Instant disqualifier.

Of course that doesn't stop the 'lead-gen-on-autopilot!' fanboys from sending, but then again: 

It also doesn't stop me from reporting them as spam.

## Cool finds

- [Texts.com](https://texts.com/). Made by Matt Mullenweg of WordPress fame, Texts gives you one single interface for a host of chats: LI direct messages, Slack channels, Telegram, Whatsapp, you name it. It's well-built and it's just a dream to not have to switch between apps all the time.
- [Publer.com](https://publer.com). A nice little tool I started using for scheduling my social media content. Easy, affordable, reliable.
- [Perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai). I'm not a fan of Facebook, but at least Perplexity is a more normal kind of experience, then ChatGPT. For one thing, it doesn't insist on vomiting words at me, and it actually seems to be more accurate.
- [OnePageCRM](https://onepagecrm.com). Recommended by my friend Gelb, OnePage has a a terrific premise, in that everything in sales is supposed to hinge on conversations. I don't use it myself because I've built my own CRM in Obsidian (don't ask), but one of my business partners started using it for her pipeline, so I use it and I recommend it.
- [Gelb](https://robertgelb.com/) is not only my mentor and a stellar human being, he's also a CEO-turned-game-designer, who's about to launch a Kickstarter for his [enormously fun board game PickleBall](https://hotshot-pickleball.com/).
- [Sid Kathirvel](https://www.kathirvel.com/), who attended my talk at CodeBase in Edinburgh last year. He's helping me figure out the best growth strategy, we talk once a week, and he's brilliant. If you're looking for a growth specialist who knows his stuff and *thinks*, you ought to hire him. 

## New content

With the multi-month break and new articles getting added to the vault each day, new content since the last issue is... well, a lot. So instead of listing all the articles, here's a selection of what you might find most useful:

- [[ü§ó The Empathy Edge]] is a series of articles that provide *lenses* for looking at your buyers and your deals. It gives you a much, much better understanding of where your buyer is at, and what they want you to say. Gets you more sales, faster. It's fun to really get people.
- For a client project in April, I created a growth system called Hidden Sales Assets. It's a full-on implementation plan that runs four months, and increases revenue by working on the four fundamental pillars of business success. You can get a free ULR here, in the shape of [a 1-page checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MbEgkkoG6WC806lZVo_qdcieN1tjvAHk/view). Don't want to miss that one.
- Of course, [bunches of new articles](https://SalesFlowCoach.app/articles) in the vault
- Oh, and I started a daily podcast! It's [here in your favourite podcast player](https://dashboard.transistor.fm/shows/sales-for-nice-people-podcast/episodes), and it's [on Youtube as well](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVS4MQCwJlbyFLRdx-QmswD0t4pIZ88DO).

## Talk Dev to me, baby

At first, SFC was just a digital garden, intended to provide content in a less linear way then a blog. So, Binny helped me set up Gatsby Garden, and for a while all was well with the world.

But then I wanted to add a paid feature, where clients can log in and send me questions by text - which isn't possible because Gatsby is static HTML.

So, I created a subdomain, installed Wordpress and Memberpress, and hoopla: member's area. Then we got to work on hacking plugins in order to provide chat functionality, and yep: it works.

As far as Jugaad goes, it's a job decently done. But, there's a couple of bugs and issues, and the system is not entirely stable.

Which poses a problem: SFC Personal is a great offer for monetising the app and generating MRR, and normally I'd promote it all over the place, but... what if I end up with 25 clients... and one day, the system crashes? Then I have 25 headaches to deal with, and I can't risk that.

So, we need to change the tech stack. We need a solution that is more robust.

Which gives me three options:

1. Either redo the Wordpress setup properly. Not a big fan of that idea, because it's such overkill: all we need is login, payment, and a 1-person thread for each client. And, there's no plugin that's actually designed to create that one-person thread, so it would be back to utter hackery anyway.
2. Rebuild the app on different platform. Flutter, webFlow, who knows... They're all good options, but it means I'd have to go back to being an app-builder, which means cannibalising time from my consulting practice, in order to do something I'm not very good at.
   And, I'd have to make a million decisions, about things like design, UX, onboarding, sequences... again, stuff that I'm not qualified for. And making decisions is costly, especially if it's not in your area of expertise.
3. Use an out-of the box solution. I've looked at dozens and dozens of options, but nothing so far fits the bill. It's either community software and everyone can see each other, or the chat interface is a bubble rather than a thread, or there's some other obstacle that makes the tool unfit.
   So, I don't really know where to take SFC personal, yet. That said, a friend recommended I check out Basecamp - which is also overkill, but at least its opinionated software, which WordPress isn't. So once I get around to it, I'll have a look to see if I can make it work in a limited way.

And that's all the Nerdy Bits I have for you this week. Thanks for reading, spread the word, and let me know if you have any Cool Finds to include next week.
