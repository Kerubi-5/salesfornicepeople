Sam Waltman of Walmart fame said:

"I'm the worst salesperson in the world, so I must make it easy to buy".

And by the looks of it and the size of Walmart, it seems like he was on to something.

So how do you make it easy to buy?

It's not necessarily easy, but it's dead simple.

You get clear on the four fundamental assets of marketing and selling:

Your USP, Avatar, the Problem-stack, and the Messaging to use.

Once you have those dialled in, you'll be running your marketing and sales with precision and focus, you'll be talking to the right people, you'll have conversations about their actual problems, and your messaging will have your buyer recognise that yes, you are the right provider to help them solve their problems.

Why am I telling you this, again?

Because it seems many of my readers have not yet downloaded the free Hidden Sales Assets checklist, and that means you're likely leaving money on the table. And since I want you to thrive, I believe it's important you get that checklist, and work through the individual steps.

So, take a moment to click and read, get the checklist, and see for yourself how elegantly simple and logical the HSA system is. And it's yours to implement, for free, if you're willing to take a bit of time for it.
