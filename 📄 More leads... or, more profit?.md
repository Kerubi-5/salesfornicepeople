What's your first thought, when the question is: How to generate more revenue and profit?

Lots of people will go for the obvious: More leads!

And yup, that works. If all else stays the same, bringing more qualified leads in will bring in more revenue.

But not necessarily profit. And, more importantly:

More leads is very often not the best, or easiest solution for getting more revenue and profit.

No, if you want a smart, and often very simple way, to generate more money?
