Today, let's do things a little differently. 
Reason being: I've recently restarted my Youtube channel and started a podcast as well, and it turns out that it's a lot of fun to record and publish things - and people tell me the videos are fun, so I thought I'd share that with you. 
So here's episode 7 of the Sales for Nice People podcast, kicking off a mini-training:
SFNP, Pillar 1: How and why to Listen to your buyer.

Enjoy!

Meanwhile, Sales for Nice People teaches you far more than you can get in a 5-minute video, and if you want to learn how to sell with less effort, more fun, more sales and more revenue, I highly recommend you check out the 10-week 1 on 1 training.
