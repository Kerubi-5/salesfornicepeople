title: 📄 Farm, don't hunt (sales for nice people)

I've never liked concepts like 'closing', or 'chasing', in sales.

And I especially don't like idea of 'hunting' for clients.

Sure, the analogy works, when applied to the selling process:

Patience, precision, understanding the prey, timing: there's a lot that carries over.

But as a mindset for looking at what selling really is, 'hunting' is a crappy analogy.

I mean, that what gets hunted usually isn't all that jazzed up about the overall experience, right?

Instead, try farming, where you [[❓Got any deals in your pipeline?|nurture, curate, foster and develop]].

Relationships, introductions, reputation, opportunities, deals, [[🤩 What is something that always delights this person?|helpfulness]]:

These are all things that exist in your business, and that you can nurture.

Whether you hunt for sales, or you develop those things in a caring and thoughtful way, is up to you.

But when you see your deals and opportunities and buyers in the light of farming, you solve the [[📄 Selling, service, and the 'good-egg problem'|'good-egg problem']], meaning: instead of your values being the reason you don't sell, they become the reason you do.

This way, you don't have to 'hunt for clients' or 'close sales' or 'chase buyers'.

You just need to 'farm' what's already there.
