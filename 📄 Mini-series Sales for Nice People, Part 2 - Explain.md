So tempting, isn't it? To fall into the explain trap, and try and convince your buyer, and come up with compelling arguments, hoping that you'll hit the bullseye so well with what you're saying, that your buyer will go 'OMG take my money!'

Exactly. 

Instead, try and have the buyer sell themselves. 

How?
