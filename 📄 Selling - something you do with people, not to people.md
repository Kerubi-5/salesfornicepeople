If there's one thing I want all ethical entrepreneurs to know, it's this:

Selling is something you do *with* people, not *to* people.

Oh sure, you can certainly get your sales and grow your business by being pushy, or forcing people, or manipulating, or bullying and shaming people into buying from you. All that stuff works, and it's really effective...

And, it's also what separates nice people from the ones without integrity. The former, they just offer something of value and ask the buyer whether or not they want to trade that something for money. No big deal, no ethics were harmed in the making of this sale.

The latter though, they don't care whether or not the purchase is right for the buyer: the just want the money.

As exemplified by the gloriously revealing statement "That's *my* money you have in your pocket".

Yes, that's actually how some people think. There's gurus out there who literally teach that. "The buyer has your money, and your job is to get that money into your pocket".

I don't know how cynical and low humans can get, but this kind of attitude is probably as rock-bottom as possible, where it comes to integrity, ethics, empathy and serving buyers.

People like us though, we don't think like that, we don't operate like that.

People like us - with values, and integrity, committed to doing right by people - we just want to help a buyer make the right decision.

Because in the end, selling with integrity comes down to just that:

Enabling the buyer to choose - to either keep the problem, or to get rid of it with your help.

And that attitude, the one where you're serving your buyer *before they even buy* is what makes selling possible for ethical entrepreneurs.

Not only that, ethical entrepreneurs who learn and internalise this attitude, consistently discover that:

a) Selling isn't all that bad, once you realise that when done right, it's an act of service

b) It can even be fun, because you're helping a buyer find the clarity they need in order to make a decision

c) It's really effective!

Why?

Because when your buyer perceives, on a visceral level, that your primary interest is for them to make the right choice, even if that's to not buy, then the level of trust they have in you goes up enormously. And obviously, without trust there's no sale.

Also, the fact that you're not pushing for a sale but instead you're facilitating a decision-making process, where you're unattached to the outcome, means your buyer will lean in, participate in the process, and collaborate with you.

Suddenly, you're no longer awkwardly trying to 'get them over the line', but instead you're having a helpful conversation that your buyer enjoys and benefits from, causing them to gradually enroll themselves into the option of buying your work.

In other words: your process of turning buyers into clients is no longer about something you do *to* your buyer, but it's something you *with* your buyer.

And I wish for every high-integrity entrepreneur to adopt this attitude and approach, and that's why I created the Sales for Nice People framework.

And, it's why the 16-week SFNP training teaches you how to strategically deploy empathy.

Because empathy - listening, understanding people, figuring out what life is like for them - is what makes the buyer want to buy.

To get that kind of outcome, [consider getting the SFNP training](https://martinstellar.com/sales-for-nice-people-info/).

You'll get 16 weeks of personal, 1 on 1 training.

And, I'll coach you on the deals in your pipeline, every week.

Plus, you get ongoing text-based support throughout (normally $99/mo).

And we kick off the programme with a 60-minute sales breakthrough session (normally $295).

Both bonuses are included in the $1490 training.

But the most important thing you'll get?

A dramatically improved ability to have conversations that turn buyers into clients.

In other words, you could get this kind of outcome:

> "I decided to give Martin a try, and our sessions have been incredibly helpful. 
> He’s uncovered challenges I didn’t even realise were holding me back and helped win more contracts.
 > I only wish I had engaged Martin sooner!
