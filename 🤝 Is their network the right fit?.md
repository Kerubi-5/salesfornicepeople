It's fun to talk to people you get along with, but:

If you are a marketing consultant for SaaS companies, looking for opportunities by talking to an old friend who's 100% into yoga and nothing else, is probably a waste of your time.

Therefore, ask yourself:

How much of a right-fit is this person's network?

To what degree do you think their network will be relevant to you - and you to them?

In column E, rank 1 for 'perfect fit', and 5 for 'completely unrelated to your world and your work'.
