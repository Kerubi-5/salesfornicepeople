Attentive readers will have noticed that I rebranded Hidden Sales Levers into Hidden Sales *Assets*.

Because after giving it some thought, I realised: It's not that the most people's sales *levers* are under-utlised: it's the sales *assets* that tend to get insufficient attention.

And you have so many of them!

Your relational capital, your IP, your past buyers, your team, your systems and SOPs and processes, your website, your social channels... you're sitting on a massive stack of assets, and each could be leveraged to produce results and returns, but do you?

Do you actually take your assets, and put a lever under them?

Take that example of the trust and standing you have with people, or as Jay Abraham calls it, your "Relational Capital".

All you need to do in order to create new opportunities, and land new clients, is have conversations with the people who know you and get what you're about.

The asset is the relational capital. The lever is having conversations.

This is why I created MYNO - the Mine Your Network for Opportunities workflow in the SFC app. It's one of the easiest ways to quickly drum up new opportunities, but most people never take the time, and instead they hire a lead gen agency, or start social media marketing, or buy ads.

And it's not that those are bad ideas - it's that unless you first explore and leverage your relationships, you spending money on new initiatives means that you're ignoring the relationships you've built, and foregoing the returns that your relationships could bring you.

Relationships that you've spent time building, and that time then goes to waste.

So if you want to get more out of your past investments of time and money, look at your assets and find ways to leverage them.

And if relationships are where you want to start, take a moment to go through the MYNO workflow, and mine your network for opportunities.

P.s. Once you've had a look at MYNO, and you want some help in figuring out what to say to your people to get new opportunities, you can [get yourself a Sales Breakthrough Session. ](https://martinstellar.com/salesbreakthroughsession/)
