excerpt: Sure, your solution is great - but how much is it going to take your buyer, to adopt and implement it?

Another [[üìÑ Are you selling them a problem? Mini series Pt 1 - congruently desirable offers|problem we often sell our buyers]], guaranteed to ruin a sale:

Adoption-cost.

Meaning: the amount of effort, resources or mental energy, that your buyer needs to spend, in order to get the outcome you promise they'll get when they buy.

Put differently: when a buyer picks up your offer, what expense or effort or friction do they have to deal with?

Aside from the financial cost in paying to get your help, what other price is there to pay for them?

For instance, imagine you‚Äôre pitching stellar web design to someone who‚Äôs understaffed and overworked.

They really need your help, because their site is ancient, broken, and the traffic doesn't convert.

A great opportunity, of course: You get to do your website magic, and they get to finally have a site that works for them.

But, for you to do your job, they need to deliver all kinds of materials to you.

Sales copy, photos, SEO reports and keywords and bio copy... a bunch of things.

That‚Äôs a high cost for someone who's overworked and short on time - so obviously, they won't buy.

No matter how wonderful your work is and how badly they need you, the problem you're 'selling' them along with your solution, is just too big. No sale.

Another example:

I will always try and get people to buy into the idea of doing email marketing, because it‚Äôs such a powerful strategy.

But for many people, the decision to send a daily email means they need to 'buy a problem' along with the solution:

‚ÄúI'll have to do it consistently and without fail and I don't want to be bound to doing that every day‚Äù.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll burn my list‚Äù.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll have enough ideas to keep going‚Äù.

So no matter how well email marketing might work, or how cleverly I pitch someone on implementing it for themselves:

For some people, the cost of adoption simply is too high and they won‚Äôt buy in.

So when your deal stalls because of adoption-cost, you have three options:

1. Reduce the cost of adoption by making it less effortful to get your solution
2. Ignore the people who consider the cost too high and instead talk to those who'll accept it
3. Have a conversation with your buyer about the adoption-cost they perceive (see: [[üìÑ Hidden Sales Assets 3 - Your ideal buyer's Problem-stack]]), and offset it against the problem-cost. In many situations, a buyer will readily get your solution, once they realise that keeping the problem is far more costly to their business, than the cost of adopting your solution.
